Want to rebase dev onto main 

git checkout main 
git merge dev 

# git rebase is a Git command that integrates changes from one branch into another

# Unlike git merge, which creates a new commit for the merge, git rebase rewrites the commit history by moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. 

# This can result in a cleaner, linear commit history.

100 commits on a branch : dev --> 1 : 6 + 4
